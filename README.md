Tema 1: Character Stack

Object Oriented Programming Project in C++

This project consists in a character stack dinamically allocated, implemented using a linked list. The user is able to pick one of the following actions: push a character, 
pop a caracter, display the stack as the same time as emptying it, display the top and the interlacing of two lists.

Tema 2: Debit Card

Object Oriented Programming Project C++

The code lets you save in memory n debit cards and gives you two types of cards : Standard and Premium. You can execute the same operations (deposit or withdraw) but when you withdraw from the premium one you get a cashback. You can also display one or all credit cards. In addition, you can display the number of objects created.

Tema 3: Pharmacy

Object Oriented Programming Project C++

Like the Debit Card project, you can save in memory n pharmacies of two types: a physical, respectively an online pharmacy. The program's main purpose is to hightlight the working of templates as if you input n physical pharmacies the program will display the pharmacies and if you input n online pharmacies the output will be the total number of visitators. Like the Debit Card project, there is a function that displays the number of objects created.
